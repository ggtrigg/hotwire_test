# Hotwire test

This is a simple app written using [Lucky](https://luckyframework.org) to explore using the [hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) approach.
At the moment it just uses the [turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) component (turbo-frames & turbo-streams).

This just implements a simple coin album collection. It has limited functionality and usefulness apart from demonstrating the hotwire approach.

### Setting up the project

1. Run `script/setup`
1. Run `lucky dev` to start the app

### Learning Lucky

Lucky uses the [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) programming language. You can learn about Lucky from the [Lucky Guides](https://luckyframework.org/guides/getting-started/why-lucky).
